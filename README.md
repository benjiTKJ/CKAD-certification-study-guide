# Learn-CKAD-With-Me
Join me as i embark on my journey to take on the [CKAD](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/ckad/) certificate!

I bought mine from [linux-foundation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/) with 20% discount 

# Purpose of this repo
- Pushing what i've learnt into Github will help serve as a reminder of how much i've learnt as well as i am able to revisit past topics easily
- This will also potentially benefit future students taking the CKAD with all the useful materials and tips that helped me

# Structure of repo
1) Exam domains 
    - The exam has 5 important domains that they will test and ive each spilt into 5 different folders with the assigned weightage (at the time of writing)
2) Mock exam questions
    - These are questions sourced online with answers and where they are sourced from
